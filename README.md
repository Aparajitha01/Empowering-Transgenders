# Empowering-Transgenders
#**Transgenders** are part of our community.Transgenders  are part of our society.But still our society is ignoring to accept this fact. So they are not opening-up themselves in this society.  But opportunities given by Government and other sectors are increasing these days. Majority of these people doesnâ€™t know about their opportunities. Opportunities reaching these people are small compared to the opportunities available.To break their inferiority complex,our team has a way to, let them know their strength and their opportunities.
We are going to develop a website named**"EMPOWERING TRANSGENDERS"**.
It contains the lists of all those websites which are creating opportunities for them.
We also showcased trans people owned business that brings about a ray of hope in the trans community.We also have added the story of successful transgender people who have achieved some key milestones in their field. **This website will showcase"What are the possibilities,what are the opportunities they have,What percent of job opportunities available for them in other countries and other information".**These details will give awareness about chances available for them to shine in their life.
